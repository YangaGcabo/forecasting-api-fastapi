GitHub description:Production-ready forecasting API using FastAPI, Pydantic, and Docker. Designed to serve trained time-series models with validation and clean engineering structure.
# Forecasting API (FastAPI)

## Purpose
This repository shows how forecasting models can be deployed in real systems.

The goal is not research code, but clean, production-ready engineering.

## API Features
- REST API using FastAPI
- Input validation with Pydantic
- Model loading and inference
- Ready for Docker deployment

## Why This Matters
Data science has value only when models can be used by other systems.

## Tools
FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, Joblib, Docker.
